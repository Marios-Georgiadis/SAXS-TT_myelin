# SAXS-TT_myelin

This demo pertains to manuscript 
“Nanostructure-specific X-ray tomography reveals myelin levels, integrity and axon orientations”, 
by Georgiadis et al., 2021, Nature Communications

It is intended to demonstrate a central feature of the study, namely the myelin-specific signal extraction from the semi-raw data -that is, after the scattering pattern for each point has been turned into q-plots for the different azimuthal segments (see Fig. 1a,b in the manuscript). 

For more details on the file structure of the “Demo” folder, instructions for running the code, requirements and dependencies and an example output figure with its subparts explained can be found in the Readme.pdf file.

For questions or concerns, please contact Marios Georgiadis at: mariosg@stanford.edu or mariosg.gr@gmail.com

Thank you
